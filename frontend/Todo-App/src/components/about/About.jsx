               Hi, I am Manthan Nimonkar, a passionate and motivated Full Stack Developer, currently pursuing my bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Technology Engineering at DYPCOE, Pune. I specialize in building dynamic and responsive web applications using the MERN stack â€” MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
               <br /><br />I enjoy creating end-to-end solutions that not only function smoothly but also offer a great user experience. My strength lies in working on both the frontend and backend, taking projects from concept to deployment.
               <br /><br />Throughout my journey, I have developed projects that solve real-world problems and improve user efficiency. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead in the tech space.
               Apart from coding, I&apos;m also a national-level chess player. Chess has sharpened my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills, which I apply directly to my development work.
